<p>Let us build a great App together!</p>

<p>Welcome to the first post from Red Ackee Software.</p>

<p>It begins, as always, with the words “I have an idea!”. That is always the beginning, which lead to the journey that got us here. And, “finally”, it is begun!</p>

<p>Red Ackee Software was begun two years ago, while life and its wiles kept us busy, this seed has been germinating into the sapling that appears before you today.</p>

<p>I am Nkosi Dilworth Founder &amp; Proprietor. Resident in Saint Petersburg, Florida. For more than a decade I have been working on commercial applications (websites &amp; mobile). Most recently I completed an iOS App for the non-profit “The Center for Biological Diversity”.</p>

<p>Come! Let us work together!</p>
