Let us build a great App together!


<!--more-->

Welcome to the first post from Red Ackee Software. 

It begins, as always, with the words "I have an idea!". That is always the beginning, which lead to the journey that got us here. And, "finally", it is begun!

Red Ackee Software was begun two years ago, while life and its wiles kept us busy, this seed has been germinating into the sapling that appears before you today.

I am Nkosi Dilworth Founder & Proprietor. Resident in Saint Petersburg, Florida. For more than a decade I have been working on commercial applications (websites & mobile). Most recently I completed an iOS App for the non-profit "The Center for Biological Diversity".

Come! Let us work together!
